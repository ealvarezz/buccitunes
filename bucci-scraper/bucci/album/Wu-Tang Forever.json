                "lyric": "(Inspectah Deck)\nYo, this goes for all my brothers and sisters locked down\nFor all my peoples incarcerated, for those who ain't make it\n\nYo, in the housing, thousands seen early graves\nVictims of wordly ways, memories stays engraved\nAll my live brothers, is locked down with high numbers\nThe young hunger, blind to these lies, they die younger\nIn this New World the Order slaughter men, women, and children\nTen feet gates surround the building keep us sealed in\nThe projects, lifeless like a vietnam vet\nConstant war, sever threats of enemy conquest\nCrooked cops comb my building complex that's in the rumble\nStreets are like a jungle, can't let my cypher crumble\nVivid thoughts, Devils resort to trick knowledge\nThey kick garbage, lust for chicks and quick dollars\nI know the pain the game bring, I did the same thing\nSpaced out in the staircase, performing a sting\nIt's hard to keep control, I bless those who seek a scroll\nTrying to reach a whole nation and break the sleeper hold\nNot a role model, I walk a hard role to follow\nI sold bottles of sorrow then chose poems and novels\nThe gospel was told, some souls it swallowed whole\nMentally they fold, and they eventually sold\nTheir life and times, deadly like the virus design\nBut too, minute to dilute, the science is mine\n\nYou can't party your life away\nDrink your life away\nSmoke your life away\nFuck your life away\nDream your life away\nScheme your life away\nCause your seeds grow up the same way\n\n(Masta Killa)\nA voice cries from the wilderness of the North\nA representation of the families that lost one\nAll victims of incarceration\nOr other divisions of the family structure\nYouths are injected with serums that leads\nTo skin irritations, babies being born with\nDisfigurations, experimentations\nOn their faces there bear world relations\nOf mothers that carry the pain\nOf blood stained streets where sisters mourn and wail\nFifth brothers been slain from hails of gun fire\nIt lightly begins to rain screams of terror\nAre hidden by the passing trains\nThis can't be little Shane, his uncle cried\nAs he drops to his nephew's side, holding his cane\nJust give me a name, of who has inflicted this\nBitter sickness, and left us to witness\n\n(U-God)\nYeah, yo\nCurses from war, innocent blood spills for days\nSoothe in godly ways, hands, solemn in praise\nTree of life, more precious than Wu is golden game\nThe wise self flourish inherit, Halls of Fame\nCrime visions in my blood got me, locked in prison\nWhile we die hard living people whine about religion, vision\nBlow, spin, and sin and killing what's revealing\nIt's a never ending battle with no ending or beginning, listen\nZero process, progress, become the hunted\nAmerica's most wanted, good life flaunted, want it\nSome love the speed, some satisfy a need\nSome want to be down, young gun seed, jungle breed\nThe stronger speed, someone die, someone bleed\nOne flew astray, and then caught my little seed\nCan it be, the ice have us trife life, made me grab the knife\nThe righteous man would be within these stripes pipes\nTake in my energy, breath and know the rest\nCause the good die young and the hard die best\n\nYou can't party your life away\nDrink your life away\nSmoke your life away\nFuck your life away\nDream your life away\nScheme your life away\nCause your seeds grow up the same way\nCause your seeds grow up the same way\nCause your seeds grow up the same way\n\n(RZA)\nY'all bitches love dances, and pulling down your pants\nWhile your man's on tour, your spending up his advances\nYour friends ain't shit, all they do is drink, smoke, and suck dick\nThe whole projects is trapped in stench\nYou either high school drop-outs, one to three cop-outs\nFifteen years old, shorty ass and top out\nNinety-nine cent beer drinking pussy stinking\nFucking so much your ass and titties start shrinking\nNew World Order slave trade, minimum wage, Medicaid\nCan a devil fool a Muslim nowadays\nInside my lab, I'm going mad\nTook two drags off the blunts, and started breaking down the flag\nThe blue is for the Crips, the red is for the Bloods\nThe whites for the cops, and the stars come from the clubs\nOr the slugs that ignites, through the night, by the dawn\nEarly light, why is sons fighting for the stripe\n\n(Method Man)\nAs we dwell through this concrete hell, calling it home\nMama say, take your time young man and build your own\nDon't wind up like your old dad\nStill searching for them glory days he never had\nSo many bad want to scheme for American dream, no more kings\nThe cash rule everything now, we going down\nThese babies looking up to us, it's up to us\nThe Million Man March MC's, get on the bus\nBut envy, greed, lust, and hate, separate\nThough the devil mind state blood kin cannot relate\nNo longer, brothers, we unstable\nLike Kane when he slew Abel, killing each other\n\nYou can't party your life away\nDrink your life away\nSmoke your life away\nFuck your life away\nDream your life away\nScheme your life away\nCause your seeds grow up the same way\nCause your seeds grow up the same way\nCause your seeds grow up the same way"

you want it niggaz it's yours\nThe flavors raw, what the fuck you think I'm flowing for\nIt's rhyme and reason, bite the bullet\nNiggaz is foul in this duck season\nWe add odds till we even motherfucker\nBad asses, high times, lower classes\nTaste mine, straight shots in dirty glasses\nBring it to him, room service, under pressure\nAnd mad nervous, waving guns at the clergy\nTicallion, we ain't worried\nKeep them sick niggaz seven-thirty\nPicture this, watch the birdy\nThis bastards is rolling dirty\nWith sharp pins that be stabbing you\nPins and needles, needles and pins\nNuff

then bone her\nBuy you some jewels, here's some food\nNot necessarily mean to be rude boo, check out the analoo\nWe in the mushrooms, chased the high neck in the custom\nBaggy jeans, thick ropes god, sliding through customs\nChill, y'all niggaz know what time it is\nJames Bond Beamers behind me, on Bacardi Lime and\nCheck out the pitch like Nolan Ryan\nHe caught a slug for lying\nYeah you was

collapsed his lung\nHis father watched the horror as he swallowed his tongue\nAnother youth dead, before the age of twenty-one\nLeft his son to grow, in the ghettoes of the slums\nWith a shot that go, for twisted metal for cash flow\nReact slow nigga and get, P.L.O.\nBy the lone gunner, who took revenge for his brother\nWho got slain last summer by a cocaine runner\nA new year is dawning, new crews is forming\nRival gangs warring blood steadily pouring\nThe streets are deep Son every day is like a rerun\nSo I reach out and try to teach one\nBut eighty-five percent uncivilized content\nNo tolerance so a lifetime is spent\nBehind a cage bent smoked out on a park bench\nKiller instinct slave rap niggaz get lynched\n\n{*Sounds of fighting*}\n\n(Verse Two: Ghostface Killah)\nSo yo break that nigga arm fast as a fuck\nTell Ra, Goldie left my beige jacket in his truck\nTo all you slow footed penguins, duckin from these\nHot rocks that's flamin, chocolate for all you rap Damian's\nSpraying cards ex-pionage, dodgeball square hard\nStrip bars, no bras, wet leotards\nAnd a mink in, next album blood on Chef's Apron\nKeep a Gambino PlayStation in your playpen\nDiscovery

dangerous\nHit you close range with this madness\nUnique design shine like a deep dish\nThe beat kick technique split all your weak shit\nYes, the rhythm, the Rebel\nAlone in my level heat it up past the boiling point of metal\nLiving legend, veteran known to set trend\nLethal weapon, step through your section\nWith the Force like Luke Skywalker\nRhyme author, orchestrate mind torture\nLive performer, bit the mic sayanora\nBorderline to insane, I rain firewater\nTape recorder, can't be saved by a court order\nI got my sword cross your throat you joke\n\n(Verse Four: Method Man)\nWe on the run with the golden guns, get you none\nWhen it reach out and teach someone, blaze they buns\nNow I'm guilty by association\nTimes of blackness eclipsin the sun, target practice\nCommence when I throw these darts at these rappers\nRicochet, hit the charts, bloody your matress\nHold me down, Wu bloodkin, I'm goin' in\nShootin bullets at the top ten, rhyme concoction\nBlend like a million\nAll

Wind Ninja scroll\nSoul edged blade controls your inner pole\nThe thick loop, fruit from the forbidden tree root\nI stay secluded in the Chamber trainin new recruits\nWith Fatal Guillotine, the black hooded team what it means\nWhen bullets scream from the hot glock like rock from a sling\n(\"Sometimes...\") Pushed through like George Bush Operation Whoops\nShots get popped on the block cause them
