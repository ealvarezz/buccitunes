(Yeah-yeah-yeah!)\nWanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh!)\nWanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah yeah!)\nTry 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)\n\nMy brain's dead weight, I'm tryin' to get my head straight\nBut I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Umm...)\nAnd Dr. Dre said, \"Slim Shady you a basehead!\"\nUh-uh! \"Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted!\"\n\nWell, since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else\n'Cause I hung my original self, from the top bunk with a belt\nGot pissed off, and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off\nAnd smacked her so hard, I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross\n\nI smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass\nFaster than a fat bitch, who sat down too fast\nC'mere slut! (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg!)\nI don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off!\n\nHi! My name is... (What?) My name is...\n(Who?) My name is... chika-chika, Slim Shady\nHi!

Ahhhhh!)\nThis guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)\nSo I signed it: 'Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole!'\n\nHi! My name is... (Huh?)

(Get him!)\nDr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!\nI'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that!)\nI'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive (Huh, yup!)\n\nAm I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide\nI just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)\nAll my life I was very deprived\nI ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops!)\n\nClothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk (Hahh-too)\nI spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (C'mere)\nWhen I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits\nHow ya gonna breastfeed me, mom?! You ain't got no tits! (Waah, wahh!)\n\nI lay awake and strap myself in the bed\nPut a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang!)\nI'm steamin' mad, (Arrhh!) and by the way when you see my dad (Yeah?)\nTell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had\n\nHi! My name is... (What?) My name is...\n(Who?) My name is... chika-chika, Slim Shady\nHi! My name is... (Huh?) My name is...\n(What?) My name is... chika-chika, Slim Shady\nHi! My name is... (Who?)

I can't take it no more, homes.)\nBut on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart.\nAnd suddenly, his conscience comes into play.\n\nDr. Dre\nAlright, stop! (Huh?) Now before you walk in the door\nOf this liquor store and try to get money out the drawer\nYou'd better think of the consequence\n(But who are you?) I'm your motherfuckin' conscience.\n\nEminem\nThat's nonsense.\nGo in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs\nAnd borrow a damn dress and one of her blonde wigs. (Can I borrow this?)\nTell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days\nIf you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades\n\nDr. Dre\nYeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to\nThe whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you.\nThink about it, before you walk in the door first.\nLook at the store clerk, she's older then George Burns.\n\nEminem\nFuck that. Do that shit. Shoot that bitch.\nCan you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?\nWhy you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?\nDo you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?\n\nDr. Dre\nMan, don't do it. It's not worth it to risk it. (You're right.)\nNot over this shit. (Stop!)\nDrop the biscuit. (I will!)\nDon't even listen to Slim, yo. He's bad for you.\n\nEminem\nYou know what, Dre? I don't like your attitude.\n\n(It's all right, c'mon, just come in here for a minute.)\n(Mmm, I don't know.)\n(Look, baby.)\n(Damn!)\n(Look, it's gonna be all right, right?)\n(Well, okay.)\n\nNarrator\nMeet Stan, 21 years old.\nAfter meeting a young girl at a rave party,\nThing's start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom.\nOnce again, his conscience comes into play.\n\nEminem\nNow listen to me: while you're kissin' her cheek\nSmearin' her lipstick,\nI slip this in her drink.\nNow all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe...\n\nDr. Dre\nYo, this girl's only 15 years old.\nYou shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair.\n\nEminem\nYo, look at her bush. Does it got hair? (Uh-huh.)\nFuck this bitch right here on the spot bare\nTill she passes out and she forgot how she got there.\n\nDr. Dre \nMan, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?\n\nEminem\nNo, but I seen the porno with Son Doobiest!\n\nDr. Dre\nShit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?\n\nEminem\nMan, fuck that, hit that shit raw dawg and bail.\n\n(Hee. It feels good to be home.)\n\nNarrator\nMeet Grady, a 29 year old construction worker.\nAfter coming home from a hard day's work, \nHe walks in the door of his trailer park home \nTo find his wife in bed with another man.\n(What the fuck?!)\n(Grady!!)\n\nDr. Dre\nAlright, calm down. Relax, start breathin'.\n\nEminem\nFuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'.\nWhile you at work, she's with some dude, tryin' to get off?\nFuck slittin' her throat!

Still wanna stab her?\nGrab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her\nThat's what I did. Be smart, don't be a retard. \nYou gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes!?\n\nDr. Dre\nWhat'd you say? \n\nEminem \nWhat's wrong?
