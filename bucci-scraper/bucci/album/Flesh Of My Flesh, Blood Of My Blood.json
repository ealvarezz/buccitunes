                "lyric": "(Talking)\nLet us pray\nI thank you Lord for my birth, and everything that's followed\nI thank you Lord for today, and I will pray for tomorrow\nI thank you Lord for the love of my life, and a friend\nI made a promise and I'm loving my wife to the end\nI thank you Lord for your guidance, 'cause it's all that counts\nAnd right here, right now, Lord, this is your house\nI thank you Lord for a dream that came true to light\nAnd I ask you to bless everybody, in this room tonight\nI don't always do the right thing, and I ask you to forgive me\n'Cause I need you here with me, without You in my life it's empty\nI think back how some people did me like, violence was the remedy\nAnd because I think of that now, I pray for my enemy\nNot because of what I'll do, but because they don't know\nThere's something better after here, but everybody, won't go\nSo I ask you to forgive them, and we'll hope they see\nAnd I thank you for the love that, they've given to me\nI will not abuse it, nor will I lead them astray\nYou see I love them like children, that I see everyday\nAnd I pray, no we pray, together\nGet us through the bad weather, and we'll love you forever\nLet your thought and my heart, go hand in hand\nI first thought, but to start, but I stand a man\nAnd for as long as I can, as long as you permit me\nPlease give me, the strength I need to live, bear with me\nAmen\n\nWe each walk the path, that we've chosen\n\n(Singing)\nI'm ready to meet him\nWe're I'm living ain't right\nBlack hate white\nWhite hate black\nIt's right back\nTo the same fight\nThey got us suspecting a war\nBut the real war is to follow the law of the lord\n\nLord, you left me stranded\nAnd I don't know why\nTold me to live my life\nNow I'm ready to die\nReady to fly\nI cry, but I shed no tears\nYou told me you would dead those fears, it's been years\nSnakes still coming at me\nJust missing\nSometimes I think all you doing me is just listen\nI thought that I was special\nThat's what you told me\nHold me\nStop acting like you don't know me\nWhat I do so bad that it sent you away from me\nNot only sent you away, but made you stay away from me\n(My child I'm here, as I've always been, it was you who went away\nAnd now are back again, what did I say)\nFollow your word, and be true\n(What did you do)\nWell, what I wanted to do\n(What have you seen)\nDarkness and hell at a glance\n(What do you want)\nAll I want is another chance\n\nI'm ready to meet him\nWe're I'm living ain't right\nBlack hate white\nWhite hate black\nIt's right back\nTo the same fight\nThey got us

got us suspecting a war\nBut the real war is to follow the law of the Lord\n\n(Just because you went away, my doors are not locked, wanna come back home,\nAll you gotta do is knock)\nYa see, I left home a boy, I returned as a man\nFull grown, and I'm still not able to stand\n(I gave you a hand)\nWell... but I was looking the wrong way\nFigured out the plan, then I started to pray\nAnd that prayer, took me from here to over there\nBack to over here,\nNow they got me like where?\nDo I belong?\nDo I fit in?\nThings on my mind, where do I begin?\nIt's easier to sin, but it hurts my heart\nI'm really tryin' to win, so where do we start?\n(Thou shall not steal)\nBut, what if he stole from me?\n(Thou shall not kill)\nBut what if he's tryin' to kill me?\n(Thou shall not, take my, name in vain, no matter how hard it rains,\nWithstand the pain)\n\nI'm ready to meet him\nWe're I'm living ain't right\nBlack hate white\nWhite hate black\nIt's right back\nTo the same fight\nThey got us suspecting a war\nBut the real war is to follow the law of the Lord\n\nI'm ready to meet him\nWe're I'm living ain't right\nBlack hate white\nWhite hate black\nIt's right back\nTo the same fight\nThey got us suspecting a war\nBut the real war is to follow the law of the Lord\n\nOur father, who art in heaven\nI'm not ashamed to ask for guidance at 27\nNo longer afraid to knock on your door\nNot scared anymore to lose my life in the war\nAfter what I just saw, I'm ridin' with the Lord\n'Cause I really can't afford to lose my head by the sword\nAnd now that I've seen, what I need to see\nPlease take me, where I need to be\n(What have you learned)\nIt's better to tell the truth than to lie\n(What have you learned)\nTo love my life until I die\n(What have you learned)\nViolence isn't always the key\n(What have you learned)\nYou can't always believe what you see\n(What have you learned)\nIt's better to forgive and forget\n(What have you learned)\nGive as you expect to get\n(What have you learned)\nThat I can't go on without you\n(What have you learned)\nI must've been a fool to ever doubt you\n\nI'm ready to meet him\nWe're I'm living ain't right\nBlack hate white\nWhite hate black\nIt's right back\nTo the same fight\nThey got us suspecting a war\nBut the real war is to follow the law of the Lord\n\nI'm ready to meet him\nWe're I'm living ain't right\nBlack hate white\nWhite hate black\nIt's right back\nTo the same fight\nThey got us suspecting a war\nBut the real war is to follow the law of the Lord\n\nI'm ready to meet him\nI'm ready to
