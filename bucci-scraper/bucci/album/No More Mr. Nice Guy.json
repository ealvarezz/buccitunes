You got the short end of the stick\n'Cause you're too quick to run tricks\nOpen your mind, widen your sight, get out of your rut\nMOVE, and get the lead out of your butt\nCause you can't live without a plan to get freshed chump\nAnd you shouldn't stand to let\nAnything sway you from the path you know is truthful\nChill, cause you know the chosen youth will\nTake over, and control the whole so don't blow it\nKnow it, cause the Guru must show it\nI'll teach you, reachin' each so you're enlightened\nEmcees are frightened, by what I write in my songs\n'Cause I express what I manifest\nWhile some of you fall down to the ground with breakdowns\nNever to see or be the same again\nFriend, cause the time you spend\nBringin' down yourself, bringin' down the pace\nBringin' down your friends, bringin' down the race\nWill have your life in a wreck\nAnd homeboy life is cause and effect\n\n* Primo scratches *\n\n(Guru)\nYou're still playin' games lame, I'll have to end you\nStraight to the gate of fate, so you can claim your doom\nWill you decay as you pay in repentance\nI light my sentence like incense\nBreathe in, expel your fears as you marvel\nHeed what I feed, you won't starve you'll make it\nBut if you don't, you will be finished\nYou'll disappear, you will diminish\nNever to see or be the same again\nFriend, cause the time you spend\nBringin' down yourself, bringin' down the pace\nBringin' down your friends, bringin' down the race\nWill leave you bugged and upset\nCause homeboy life is cause and effect\nCause and effect!\n\n* Primo scratches *\n\n(Guru)\nOnce again, Premier and the Guru\nIt's like that"
