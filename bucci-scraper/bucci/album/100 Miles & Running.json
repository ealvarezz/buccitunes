But with a little help from my friends, I found a light in the tunnel at the end. Now you're calling me up on the phone. So you can have a little whine and a moan. And it's only because you're feeling alone\n\nNah, I'm just kinda bored, baby\n\nAt first, when I see you cry - Yeah it makes me smile. Yeah it makes me smile. At worst I feel bad for a while, but then I just smile, I go ahead and smile\n\nWho you talkin' about me? Oh nah\n\nWhenever you see me you say that you want me back. And I tell you it don't me jack, No it don't mean jack\n\nWe'll see about that\n\nI couldn't stop laughing. No I just couldn't help myself. See you messed up my mental health.

See I aim like (Aine) Her Frame her mind was nothin' to be pictured. But she ain't wanna listen. We kick like Fulham. And it was just a quickie. But really wanna make love and Lily my religion. Simply, I can be that and all that. I got cheese I could turn you to a mall rat. I won't leave 'em at your door like a doormat. And I'm a keep knockin' at it like a Morman. The more men lie, the more she saw from 'em, protection she endorsed by endorphins. The other girl I adored was a whore joint. The neighborhood roller her mother was an orphanage. No tears, those so tears zero From here on out I am all about dinero like Pesci. so now let the lets be set free and see if we're lovers or enemies. Test me\n\nAt first, when I see you cry - Yeah it makes me smile. Yeah it makes me smile. At worst I feel bad for a while, but then I just smile, I go ahead and smile"
