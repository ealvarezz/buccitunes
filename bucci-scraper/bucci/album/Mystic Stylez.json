RIDE\nThe South Gatin' skatin' ring later on that night\nWe in the lot bumpin' our underground rap tapes\nPaul and Juicy part 2, and for another one, they just couldn't wait\nWe back at the crib sweatin' into the room\nW-30's SB12's and MPC's we use\nStraight from the 4 track, to a simple cassette\nThat's through a pimpsta's mode.\nNow it's time to hit the stereos stores and collect\nWe at the club Friday's and Saturday's special request made\nMe and Juice Man hit the tables, scooped the Scarecrow off the stage\nThey get so buck, there some fools always gotta start a fight\nThey usually made us close up early that night, In Da Summa. In Da Summa\n\nPimpin' my grooves, We got to ride\nRidin' through the door with my homies gettin' smoked out. In Da Summa.(4x)\n\n(Koopsta Knicca)\nDrunk off red dog, as we bump through the mystic fog\nMe, Scarecrow, Crunchy, Skinny G, and all my bothaz call\nFly got his mind in the sky as we chiefin' blunts\nBlack Glocks that's in the ride fiendin' for a homicide\nSome Tanqueray grab my yey mess with little seeds\nThat's how we always did it since I was a troubled kid\nBut we don't stop 'cause our heart is pumpin' blood like thunder\nNo man up in the trauma, head is broken In Da Summa\n\n(Lord Infamous)\nSeasons of the summer the Scarecrow want the ceremony till the sun sets me ease\nUntil the night fall breeze\nRise up to the darkness, listen close to noises in the streets\nGrab my Oz. of Indonesia, 6 Philly Blunt leaves\nDon't want me black khaki slacks and me black t-shirt\nAnd my automatic gats in case I had to dig up a plot of dirt\nThen hit Paul up on his home\nTell him to bring his slow ass on\nSo we can hit the honey comb before the ganja's gone, Da Summa\n\n(Juicy J)\nPass to little J, Koop. Then let's take a ride and shoot\nTo the high school, North Side where the playaz rule\nI'm scopin' all the freaks, with some weave and a sexy switch.\n\"Can I get ya numba\"\n\n(Gangsta Boo) \"I gotta man\"\n\n(Juicy J)\nWell I'm a holla trick\nBallin down violent time, one time on my mind\nIf they pull me over I be hopin' they won't find the nine\nMade enough from evergreen to holla at Blac and Cam\nChiefin' on the blunts in the alley slangin' balla', yeah\nCouldn't forget my roadie big Kurt, Swally, and Dion\nProject Pat and the \"L\" Larry shootin' teflon\nJust a few homies who I grew up in the hood with me\nAnd the ones in Orange Blossom (?) University.
